            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Clever Headrest That Could Make Flying Actually Bearable</h1><p>There are many reasons to hate flying economy. The tiny seats, the inedible food, the fees airlines charge for things you'd get for free in a medieval dungeon. Manon KÃ¼hne can't fix any of that, but she's has found one small way to make sitting in 17C just a bit less hellish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dc283ca637a9ed4e81f27749130ffccde596046.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why You Need to Love Yourself More</h1><p>I used to believe that love meant putting everyone else and their needs first, before my own. While I do think there is some truth to that, in the sense that being a giving person is one of the ultimate acts of being a loving person, I came to realize that I must give to and love myself first and foremost.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/75b6a2a90ce8ffccabb83684f228ad6037de398f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Stunning Mansion in Ex Machina</h1><p>There are many stunning, otherworldly sights in Ex Machina, the science-fiction film directed by Alex Garland that features a robot so lifelike she's played by actress Alicia Vikander. But the most breathtaking sight of all may be the 100 percent real, available-for-a-night's-stay location where the film is set: the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/681669ff82d513a623869d49c9b8fe8ee3c88229.jpg"></article>]]></description>
